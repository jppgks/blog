On my quest to make machine learning accessible to everyone that's interested, 
I believe in the power of an integrated application.
This is a codebase that not only contains the code used for the research paper, 
but also uses it to create a user-facing interface that demonstrates a real feature
that's made possible by the machine learning model.

This close connection of research and application, 
gives an example of a complete workflow that simulates a real-world project.

## Making images _Scream_
One area of research that is closely related to a fun, real-world application is _neural style transfer_.
The goal here is to take an image and apply the style of another image to it.
A typical example is to transfer the style of a _painting_ onto a photo. 

In this post, I'll sketch out the steps I went through to create a user-facing application
that allows the user to upload a picture and then get the result of applying a chosen style
to the given image.

You can find a demo of the application [here]().

Here's an overview of our process:
