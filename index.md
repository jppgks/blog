<div class="post-intro">
<p>
I have a lot of interests and, while I’m studying as an undergraduate in CS at KU Leuven University, most of my time is spent on side projects. 
Most of this website is dedicated to my current “side project” in machine learning. 
</p>
<p>
At the moment, I’m doing research for my bachelor’s thesis into text-to-image synthesis with generative adversarial networks. 
It wasn’t until recently that I discovered machine learning and I decided to keep track of my progress in the field.
