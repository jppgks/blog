<p>
As my undergraduate in Computer Science at KU Leuven University progressed, I started to specialize in machine learning.
I document my continuous learning progress in the post titled <a href="/machine-learning-path">“machine learning path”</a>. 
</p>
<p>
For my bachelor thesis, I implemented a generative adversarial network to generate realistic images from textual descriptions.
I did an <a href="/research-internship-summer2018">applied research internship</a> at KU Leuven University after that in which I employed a state-of-the-art natural language understanding model for keyword extraction.
</p>
<p>
As of January 2019, I decided to pursue machine learning professionally. I started <b>Daydream</b>, a one-person machine learning consultancy business. I’m available to do contract work for machine learning or data science, <a href="m&#97;il&#116;o&#58;&#106;opp%65&#64;%&#55;&#50;&#118;r%69%65&#46;%63&#111;m">contact me</a> for details!
