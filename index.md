<div class="post-intro">
<p>
As my undergraduate in Computer Science at KU Leuven University progressed, I developed an interest and passion for analytics in the broad sense. I started to specialize in machine learning. I document my continuous learning progress in the post titled <a href="/machine-learning-path">“machine learning path”</a>.<br/> 
For my bachelor thesis, I implemented a generative adversarial network to generate realistic images from textual descriptions. I did an <a href="/research-internship-summer2018">applied research internship</a> at KU Leuven after that in which I employed a state-of-the-art natural language understanding model for keyword extraction.
</p>
<p>
As of January 2019, I decided to pursue machine learning professionally. I started <b>Daydream</b>, a one-person machine learning consultancy business. I’m available to do contract work for machine learning or data science, <a href="m&#97;il&#116;o&#58;&#106;opp%65&#64;%&#55;&#50;&#118;r%69%65&#46;%63&#111;m">contact me</a> for details!
</p>
<p>
Through my software development internships at VikingCo & T-Mining, my research internship at KU Leuven University and my extracurricular work with my student association Emergent, I experienced first-hand the importance of collaboration and <b>interdisciplinary teams</b>.<br/>
I am convinced that an optimal solution can only be achieved by using the knowledge of a diverse group of people that span a wide range of backgrounds. I carried this mindset throughout my activities at Emergent where we make data science accessible to an interdisciplinary group of students.<br/>
As board member and responsible for partner relations, I learned the subtleties of collaborating with clients and the importance of understanding customer needs. I was also responsible for the organization of our <b>Data 4 Good Challenge</b>. This event gathers 125 students that work together in complementary teams on a data analytics case. Deliverables include data insights, visualization and a roadmap to tackle food insecurity. <br/>
During my time with Emergent, I acquired leadership skills that I am developing further to support teams in performing at the highest level.
