<div class="post-intro">
<p>
As my undergraduate in Computer Science at KU Leuven University progresses, I started to specialize in machine learning.
In the post titled <a href="/machine-learning-path">“machine learning path”</a>, I keep track of my progress.

At the moment, I’m doing research for my bachelor’s thesis into text-to-image synthesis with generative adversarial networks. 
It wasn’t until recently that I discovered machine learning and I decided to keep track of my progress in the field.
